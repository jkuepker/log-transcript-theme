# log-transcript-theme

Formerly `claude-chat-style`: Claude Code 2.1.288 reserves plugin names that
start with `claude-`. GitHub redirects the old repository URL here.

A Claude Code plugin that draws the transcript as a log: every row opens
with a coloured role label, tool calls fold to one line, and the `details ›` button beside a
label opens that row's details in a pane docked beside the transcript.

![Claude Code in a terminal with this plugin: YOU, TOOL, CLAUDE and CLAUDE ? labels, tool calls folded to one line each, a failed call marked in red, then a details › click opening a row in the side pane](docs/demo.gif)

| Row | Drawn as |
|---|---|
| Your prompt | **YOU** (blue), then the text as typed; a fenced block (```` ``` ```` or `~~~`) is drawn as code, with its language |
| Your prompt with attachments | the same, then a line per attachment: `▣ image 1 · header.png`, or for a paste, which has no file name, `▣ image 2 · PNG`. The picture itself is not drawn: a plugin is not given its bytes |
| Claude's reply | **CLAUDE** (magenta), then the markdown as usual |
| Claude's question | **CLAUDE ?** (yellow): the reply's last paragraph outside code ends with `?` |
| A multiple-choice question (AskUserQuestion) | **CLAUDE ?** over its answered card in the terminal, and a **CLAUDE ?** line above Claude Code's own dialog while it waits for you |
| A finished tool call | **TOOL** (orange) and one short line: what was called, in a few words, then what it came to: `Bash Run the tests → 14 passed`, `Edit fetch.ts → +12 −3`. A shell call shows its description, or its command less a leading `cd … &&`; a file call its file's name; an MCP call its server and tool (`unanimis unim_recall`), never its JSON. Result noise (`Shell cwd was reset to …`, an edit's success sentence, `(Bash completed with no output)`, a JSON reply) is left to the pane |
| A running or failed tool call | **TOOL** (orange, red on failure) over Claude Code's own drawing |
| A folded group (`Ran 2 shell commands`) | **TOOL** and one short line per call, as above, `→ failed` in red for a failed one; while it runs or under ctrl+o, Claude Code's own drawing, each call with its own **TOOL** |

Click `details ›` beside any label to open the **Details** pane. A tool call has
**Summary** (tool, status, input, result, duration), **Payload** (its input as
JSON), **Result** (its output) and **Timing** (step, start, finish,
duration). A prompt or reply has **Summary** (its length, and a prompt's
attachments), **Preview** (the text rendered) and **Raw** (the source, with
the attachments listed). The colours are Ultra Atom One
Dark's.

Only prompts you type get the YOU label; task notifications, teammates and
other senders keep Claude Code's own row.

Works in the terminal and in the desktop app's Code tab, checked by eye on
2026-10-02 with Claude Code 2.1.286 to 2.1.288. In the desktop app the pane
docks to the right of the transcript; in the terminal it docks in fullscreen
mode at 110 columns or more, and otherwise opens above the prompt. The desktop
app draws some rows itself, and those keep its look: the text inside its own
groups of tool calls, a message that is only images, and an answered
multiple-choice question, which it shows as its own receipt card without asking
the plugin (a dismissed or timed-out question is a plain tool row and keeps its
label). Code blocks in your prompts were checked by eye in the desktop app on
2026-10-03 (0.6.10); in the terminal they are checked by tests only.
The compact tool rows of 0.6.11, and another plugin's long log lines kept off
the transcript (fast-decmo-compaction's decisions on a 790-message compaction),
were checked by eye in the desktop app on 2026-10-04; in the terminal they are
checked by tests only.

It uses Claude Code's early-access function hooks (`ui.render`), which may
change between Claude Code releases; `types/claude-code.d.ts` was written by
Claude Code 2.1.286.

## Install

You need Claude Code 2.1.283 or later, in a terminal or the desktop app.

- **Required before installing:**

  Turn on function hooks, which this plugin uses and which are off by
  default (they are early access). Add this to the `env` block of
  `~/.claude/settings.json`, creating the block if there is none:

  ```json
  "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS": "1" }
  ```

  <br>

- **Option 1: Install directly from GitHub**

  1. Run the following commands:

     ```sh
     claude plugin marketplace add jkuepker/log-transcript-theme
     claude plugin install log-transcript-theme@log-transcript-theme
     ```

  2. Start a new `claude` session in a terminal. A session that is already
     open keeps its old look until you restart it.

  Note: `marketplace add` fetches the repository itself, so no clone is needed.

  <br>

- **Option 2: Clone from GitHub and install**

  1. Run the following commands (`./` or a full path; a bare `.` is rejected):

     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/jkuepker/log-transcript-theme.git
     cd log-transcript-theme
     claude plugin marketplace add ./
     claude plugin install log-transcript-theme@log-transcript-theme
     ```

  2. Start a new `claude` session in a terminal.

  <br>

- **To update**

  ```sh
  cd /path/to/log-transcript-theme && git pull   # Option 2 only
  claude plugin marketplace update log-transcript-theme
  claude plugin update log-transcript-theme@log-transcript-theme
  ```

  Then restart `claude`.

  <br>

- **To uninstall**

  ```sh
  claude plugin uninstall log-transcript-theme@log-transcript-theme
  claude plugin marketplace remove log-transcript-theme
  ```

  <br>

- **To try it for one session without installing:**

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/jkuepker/log-transcript-theme.git
  cd log-transcript-theme
  claude --plugin-dir ./
  ```

## Options

`/plugin configure log-transcript-theme@log-transcript-theme`, or
`--config KEY=VALUE` at install:

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | off leaves Claude Code's own drawing |
| `compact` | `true` | tool calls summed up in a few words, and another plugin's `$.ui.log` line that runs past one line or 160 characters kept in the debug log (`claude --debug`) only; off shows each call's whole input and result, and every log line |
| `youColor` | `#4280FE` | the YOU label: a hex colour or a theme key |
| `claudeColor` | `#DE77FF` | the CLAUDE label |
| `questionColor` | `#FEDC71` | the CLAUDE ? label |
| `toolColor` | `#FF995A` | the TOOL label |

## Make your own style

The colours are settings (above), so a different palette needs no code. For
a different look altogether, fork the repository: the whole drawing is
`hooks/log-transcript-theme.tsx`, one `ui.render` hook per row kind (your prompts,
Claude's text, tool calls and results, the pane) that returns a tree of
`Box`, `Text` and `Button` elements, and
`types/claude-code.d.ts` lists every element and prop a hook can use. Give
your fork its own `name` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so it can be installed beside this one, and
run `npm test` to check the drawing on the terminal and desktop surfaces.

## License

MIT (see `LICENSE`): use, change and share it, including as your own style.

## Demo GIF

`docs/demo.gif` is a real Claude Code session, recorded with

```sh
claude plugin disable log-transcript-theme@log-transcript-theme   # if installed
DEMO_COLS=150 DEMO_ROWS=32 DEMO_CLICK_SECONDS=20 GIF_WIDTH=1280 \
  demo/record-gif.sh docs/demo.gif /path/to/a/trusted/git/repository
claude plugin enable log-transcript-theme@log-transcript-theme
```

An installed copy would draw every row a second time, hence the disable.
The last 20 seconds are for a person to click a row's `details ›` and the
pane's tabs; at 150 columns the pane docks beside the transcript.

It runs `claude --plugin-dir .` in a private tmux server, shows it in a new
Ghostty window, types three prompts (two shell commands, a failing one and a question back,
an answer; only `ls`, `git log` and `npm run` may run unasked), records that window with ScreenCaptureKit (`demo/wincap.swift`, so
other windows may cover it) and encodes a 960 px, 15 fps GIF. Needs tmux,
ffmpeg, Ghostty and Screen Recording permission. Two things it works around:
Claude Code drops to 256 colours when it sees tmux, so the session hides tmux
from it, and the tmux server starts with a clean environment so the session
looks like a fresh terminal's.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck   # tsc over hooks, tests and the API types
npm test            # claude plugin test .
npm run validate    # claude plugin validate
```
